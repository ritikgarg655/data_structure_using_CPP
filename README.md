# Data Structure using C++
This repository contain my practice done to learn DataStructure.

## Each folder contain:
  1. Code using class.
  2. Implementation using STL library.

## Folder content:
  ### 1. array:<br>
     A. static and dynamic array implementation.
     B. Usin STL implementation.
  ### 2. Linked List: 
     The problem with array is that it is not efficient in terms of memory. It always double the size, loss 
     of memory,but it is not in linked list but required double size, another to save addrress.
     Time comlexity of following operation in linked list:
       A. Insertion: O(N)
       B. Deletion:  O(N)
       C. Access:    O(N)
  ### 3. Stack:
     It is LIFO (last in, first out).
     Uses of stack:
        A. Used to undo in text editor.
        B. Tower of annoy problem.
        C. To check brackets in code in text editor.
        D. Used in dfs.
  
  ### 4. Queue:
    Queue implementaion using single linked list. Queue is FIFO (first in, first out)
    Time comlexity of following operation in queue:
       A. ENQUEUE: O(1)
       B. DEQUEUE:  O(1)
       C. SIZE:    O(N)
  ### 5. Periority queue:
    In periority queue, each element has some periority and according to which enqueue, dequeue and other function
    is implemented. Binary tree is used for implmentation. Hash table is used to remove element value wise in 
    O(Log N).
      A. Enqueue: O(Log N)
      B. Dequeue: O(Log N)
      C. Size: O(1)
      D. Remove_using value: O(Log N)
      E. Dequeue using index: O(Log N)
  ### 6. Union find:
     Union find is used to uinon two set and find is used to find in which set value belongs.
      A. union: aplha(n)
      B. Find: aplha(n)
      C. construct: O(n)
  ### 7. BST (Binary search tree):
    BST is tree which is acylic and has maximum two child for each parent. BST child has some constraint i.e. Left
    child is less than parent and right child is more than parent with respect to comparision function.
       A. Add element: O(Log N) 
       B. Remove element: O(Log N)
       C. Present: O(Log N)
     Travelsal in BST:
       A. Preorder (first left).
       B. Inorder.
       C. Postorder (first right).
       D. Level (level wise).
  ### 8. Hash table:
    Hash table is key value pair, having hash function(H(x)) which which has input key and value, and output in 
    specific range. Hash function map to only value in range which is index of our hash function. Key is called 
    hasable means key used is immutable and key is in domain of hash function. Aplha is sensitivity feactor, 
    which is used to remove over size. Their may be condition when different set of key value pair point to 
    same index, such condtion is known as collision. Their are many collision resolution method, here we are
    going to explore:
      A. Seperate chaining: Used extra linked list to save pair for each index.
      B. Open addresing: Used probing to change index if already value exist at that index.
        1. Linear probing: P(x) = a * x + b.
        2. Quadratic probing: P(x) = a * X^2 + b * x + c.
     For optimise probing their is condtion on probing function to avoid cylce aslo after using probing:
      A. Linear probing: GCD( A,N) should be one and a = 1 is used many time, if a!=1 than as capacitity 
         is increased, according to which a should change.
      B. Quadratic probing: 
        1. P(X) = X^2 and n (size of table) as prime>3 and alpha <=0.5.
        2. P(x) = (X^2 +X)/2 and N is in poer of two (Using here).
        3. P(x) = ((-1)^X) * X^2.
